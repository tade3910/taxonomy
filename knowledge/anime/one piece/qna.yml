      Monkey D. Luffy also known as "Straw Hat" Luffy,
      is a fictional character and the protagonist in the Japanese manga 
      series One Piece created by Eiichiro Oda. 
      Luffy made his debut as a young boy who acquires the 
      properties of rubber after accidentally eating one 
      of the Devil Fruits that belonged to "Red Hair" Shanks.
      Monkey D. Luffy is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, 
      and dreamt of being a pirate since childhood from the influence 
      of his idol and mentor Red-Haired Shanks. At the age of 17, 
      Luffy sets sail from the East Blue Sea to the Grand Line in 
      search of the legendary treasure, One Piece, to succeed Gol D. Roger 
      as "King of the Pirates".
      He fights multiple antagonists, and aids and befriends 
      the inhabitants of several islands on his journey. 
   question: What kind of cat is a tabby?
 - answer: |
      When Eiichiro Oda created Luffy, he strove for a 
      "manliness" similar to that of Akira Toriyama's Dragon 
      Ball series. Oda said that he named his main character "Luffy" 
      because he felt that the name suited him. 
      When he later learned about the sailing term, 
      "luffing", he was delighted by the coincidence.
      In his prototype one-shot, "Romance Dawn", 
      Oda refined the artistic style and story elements 
      before publishing the final product a year 
      later as the first chapter of One Piece. 
      In the second version of "Romance Dawn", 
      Luffy resembled his design at the beginning of the series. 
      After the one-shot of One Piece was made, 
      Oda contacted his former mentor, Nobuhiro Watsuki, 
      whom he assisted in making the manga Rurouni Kenshin. 
      Watsuki was pleased with Luffy's characterization and 
      advised Oda to briefly change him for the main series 
      to make it look like Luffy is always acting on his own free will.
      To please his readers, Oda added rubberization to Luffy for 
      comic effect and tries to make the character straightforward. 
      In retrospect, Watsuki felt characters like Luffy reflect a 
      trend of heroes who do not kill their enemies similar to his 
      character Himura Kenshin 
   question: How was the character of Monkey D Luffy Developed
 - answer: | 
      In the original Japanese version of the One Piece anime 
      series and later spin-offs of the franchise, 
      Luffy is voiced by Mayumi Tanaka. Tanaka said jokingly 
      that she regrets providing Luffy's voice because 
      she is a mother in real life and Luffy is much younger.
      Asked about her voicing, Tanaka said that she 
      "strives for reality" in scenes where Luffy speaks when 
      he is eating or touching his nose. In the OVA Defeat 
      the Pirate Ganzack!, Luffy was voiced by Urara Takano.
      In Odex's English-dubbed VCDs produced by Voiceovers Unlimited, 
      Luffy is voiced by Chuck Powers, the director of 
      said English version. In this edition his name is 
      mispronounced as "Luh-fee" (/ˈlʌfiː/).
      The character was voiced by Erica Schroeder in 4Kids 
      Entertainment's English-language dubs of the franchise 
      between 2004–2006. Following Funimation/Crunchyroll's 
      acquisition of the franchise license in 2007, 
      Colleen Clinkenbeard became the voice of Luffy in 
      all English-language releases.
      In the live action adaptation of One Piece, 
      Luffy is portrayed by Mexican actor Iñaki Godoy.
      Godoy and Tanaka reprised their roles as Luffy in the 
      Spanish and Japanese dubs of the adaptation respectively.      
   question: Who has portrayed the character of Monkey D Luffy  
 - answer: |
      Throughout One Piece, the bounty placed on Luffy continually 
      increases as he faces off against increasingly powerful pirates, 
      representing his notoriety in the One Piece world. 
      After defeating Buggy, Don Krieg, and Arlong of East Blue, 
      early on in the series, Luffy's initial bounty is set 
      to 30,000,000 Berries. By the major timeskip in One Piece, 
      this number had increased to 400,000,000 Berries after 
      defeating some of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, r
      ampaging at Enies Lobby, and retaking Nico Robin.
      In current arcs, Luffy's total bounty has increased to 
      3 billion Berries after becoming one of the 
      "Four Emperors in the New World."
   question: What is the bounty of Monkey D Luffy

      Gear 2 (ギア2セカンド, Gia Sekando), which increases his strength 
      and speed for a short time but strains his body and can 
      shorten his lifespan if used too long. Observing CP9's Shave 
      (剃, Soru) technique, Luffy adapts the move to his rubber 
      body and matches the assassins' speed. Gear 3 (ギア3サード, Gia Sādo),
      another technique, uses air in his bones to attack but makes
      him shrink afterward. Luffy can use both techniques simultaneously; 
      after the two year time skip, he gains better control of
      these techniques and is no longer affected by their drawbacks.
      Luffy develops another technique, Gear 4 (ギア4フォース, Gia Fōsu) 
      (similar to Gear 3), inflating his muscles with air to 
      increase the size of his body (except for his legs) while 
      his limbs are coated in Armament Haki. In contrast to Gears 2 and 3, 
      Luffy uses compression rather than extension for his attacks, 
      compressing and releasing his limbs to dish out devastating blows. 
      The force of his kicks are to an extent that he uses them to 
      fly in a similar fashion to CP9's Moon Walk (月歩, Geppō) 
      technique.
      Later, it is revealed that the Gum-Gum Fruit's real name is 
      the "Human-Human Fruit, Model: Nika", a Mythical 
      Zoan-type Devil Fruit whose "awakening" grants Luffy's 
      rubber-like body increased strength and freedom, including
      turning the environment and other living beings into rubber, 
      which is limited only by the user's imagination. 
      It is for this reason that the user is said to become a 
      trickster sun god known as the "embodiment of freedom", 
      able to bring joy to the people around them and making it
      "the most ridiculous power in the world". In Gear 5 
      (ギア5フィフス, Gia Fifusu), Luffy's hair and clothes also 
      turn white. The World Government renamed it to erase the 
      fruit's original name from history and reclassified it as a 
      Paramecia in order to conceal its true nature.
      The fruit was originally a treasure sought by the World 
      Government for over 800 years until it was stolen by Red-haired 
      Shanks. According to the Five Elders, the fruit had 
      not been awakened for centuries prior to Luffy's having done so.
